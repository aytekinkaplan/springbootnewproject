**Spring Boot Student Application**

This project demonstrates a basic Spring Boot application for managing student data. It utilizes JPA for data persistence and exposes a simple REST API endpoint.

**Features:**

* Manages student entities with name, email, and birth date.
* Calculates student age based on birth date (not persisted).
* CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for students.

**Prerequisites:**

* Java 17+
* PostgreSQL database

**Setup:**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aytekinkaplan/springbootnewproject.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

3. Configure a PostgreSQL database connection (refer to Spring Boot documentation for details on datasource configuration).

**Running the application:**

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. The application will run on port 8080 by default.

**REST API Endpoint:**

*Currently, there's no implemented API endpoint for student management. You can build upon this project to implement functionalities like:*

* GET `/students`: Retrieve a list of all students.
* GET `/students/{id}`: Retrieve a student by ID.
* POST `/students`: Create a new student.
* PUT `/students/{id}`: Update an existing student.
* DELETE `/students/{id}`: Delete a student.

**Technologies Used:**

* Spring Boot
* Spring Data JPA
* PostgreSQL (optional, for persistence)
